# Quick Start: Automatic SSL Termination

**Feature**: 002-automatic-ssl-termination
**Date**: 2025-10-18

## Overview

This guide shows how to use ddollar's automatic SSL certificate trust feature. After this feature is implemented, users will enjoy zero-friction SSL setup - no manual certificate trust steps required.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Post-Implementation)

### One Command Setup

```bash
# Set your API tokens
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

# Start ddollar (requires sudo for automatic trust)
sudo ddollar start
```

**That's it!** SSL certificates are automatically trusted. No manual steps.

### What Happens Automatically

When you run `sudo ddollar start`:

1. ‚úì Creates local Certificate Authority (CA) if needed
2. ‚úì Installs CA to system trust stores
3. ‚úì Generates SSL certificate for AI providers
4. ‚úì Starts HTTPS proxy on port 443

**Result**: API calls work immediately with no SSL warnings.

---

## üéØ User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Setup (Ideal Path)

**User**: Developer installing ddollar for the first time

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Install ddollar
curl -LO https://github.com/ahoward/ddollar/releases/latest/download/ddollar-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m)
chmod +x ddollar-*
sudo mv ddollar-* /usr/local/bin/ddollar

# 2. Set API tokens
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# 3. Start with sudo (for automatic trust)
sudo ddollar start
```

**Output**:
```
Starting ddollar...
Discovering API tokens...
  ‚úì Loaded 1 token(s) for Anthropic
Setting up SSL certificates...
  Creating certificate authority...
  ‚úì CA installed to system trust store
  ‚úì CA installed to NSS trust store (Firefox)
  ‚úì Certificate authority trusted
  ‚úì Generated certificates
Starting proxy on port 443...
‚úì ddollar running
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Make an API call - should work with no SSL warnings
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "max_tokens": 16, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

**Expected**: Response with no certificate errors.

---

### Scenario 2: Running Without Sudo (Fallback Path)

**User**: Developer who forgets sudo or doesn't have admin privileges

**Steps**:
```bash
# Start without sudo
ddollar start
```

**Output**:
```
Starting ddollar...
Discovering API tokens...
  ‚úì Loaded 1 token(s) for Anthropic
Setting up SSL certificates...
  Creating certificate authority...
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Automatic certificate trust failed: permission denied

Manual trust instructions for macOS:
  sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
      -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \
      ~/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem

Proxy is starting anyway. API calls will fail until certificates are trusted.
To manually trust certificates, run: sudo ddollar trust

Starting proxy on port 443...
‚úì ddollar running (certificates not trusted yet)
```

**User Action**:
```bash
# Stop proxy
ddollar stop

# Trust certificates manually
sudo ddollar trust

# Start again
sudo ddollar start
```

**Verification**: API calls now work.

---

### Scenario 3: Status Check

**User**: Developer wants to see SSL certificate status

**Steps**:
```bash
ddollar status
```

**Output**:
```
ddollar status:
  Hosts file modified: true
  Tokens discovered: 1
  Providers configured: 1

Certificates:
  CA certificate: ~/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem
  CA trusted: ‚úì Yes (system + NSS)
  Leaf certificate: ~/.ddollar/certs/cert.pem
  Valid until: 2026-10-18 (342 days remaining)
  Domains: api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, api.cohere.ai, generativelanguage.googleapis.com

Configured providers:
  - Anthropic: 1 token(s)
```

**Key Info**:
- ‚úì "CA trusted: Yes" means SSL is working
- ‚úó "CA trusted: No" means manual trust needed
- "Valid until" shows certificate expiration (auto-renewed if needed)

---

### Scenario 4: Restricted Environment (Docker)

**User**: Developer running ddollar in Docker container

**Context**: Docker containers often can't modify host trust stores

**Steps**:
```bash
# In Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates
COPY ddollar /usr/local/bin/

# Run (won't have sudo in container)
CMD ["ddollar", "start"]
```

**Output**:
```
Starting ddollar...
...
Setting up SSL certificates...
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Automatic certificate trust failed: trust store not writable

Manual trust instructions:
  1. Copy CA certificate from container:
       docker cp <container>:~/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem ./ddollar-ca.pem
  2. Trust on host system:
       sudo security add-trusted-cert ... (macOS)
       sudo cp ... && sudo update-ca-certificates (Linux)
  3. Restart container

Proxy is starting anyway. API calls will fail until certificates are trusted.
```

**User Action**:
```bash
# Extract CA from container
docker cp ddollar-container:/root/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem ./ddollar-ca.pem

# Trust on host (macOS example)
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
    -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \
    ./ddollar-ca.pem
```

**Result**: Requests from container now trusted by host browser/tools.

---

### Scenario 5: Uninstallation

**User**: Developer removing ddollar from system

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Remove certificate trust
sudo ddollar untrust

# 2. Remove ddollar files
rm -rf ~/.ddollar

# 3. Remove binary
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ddollar
```

**Output (step 1)**:
```
Removing ddollar CA certificate...
‚úì CA removed from system trust store
‚úì CA removed from NSS trust store

ddollar certificates are no longer trusted by your system.
```

**Result**: Complete cleanup, no trust store artifacts remain.

---

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Manual Trust Commands

For explicit control over certificate trust:

```bash
# Install trust (alternative to automatic on start)
sudo ddollar trust

# Force reinstall trust
sudo ddollar trust --force

# Remove trust
sudo ddollar untrust

# Check trust status
ddollar status | grep "CA trusted"
```

### Certificate Locations

All certificates stored in `~/.ddollar/`:

```
~/.ddollar/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ca/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rootCA.pem       # CA certificate (public)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rootCA-key.pem   # CA private key
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ certs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cert.pem         # Leaf certificate
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ key.pem          # Leaf private key
```

**To inspect CA**:
```bash
# View certificate details
openssl x509 -in ~/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem -text -noout

# Check fingerprint
openssl x509 -in ~/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem -fingerprint -noout
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Automatic trust failed"

**Symptoms**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Automatic certificate trust failed: permission denied
```

**Causes**:
- Ran without sudo/admin privileges
- Trust store is locked or read-only
- Running in restricted environment (Docker, corporate machine)

**Solutions**:
1. Run with sudo: `sudo ddollar start`
2. Manually trust: `sudo ddollar trust`
3. Follow platform-specific instructions printed by ddollar

---

### Issue: "SSL certificate warnings in browser"

**Symptoms**:
- Browser shows "Not secure" or certificate error
- curl shows `SSL certificate problem`

**Causes**:
- CA not trusted by system
- Using Firefox with NSS (may need separate trust)

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check trust status
ddollar status

# If "CA trusted: No":
sudo ddollar trust

# For Firefox specifically:
certutil -A -n "ddollar Local CA" -t "C,," \
    -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb \
    -i ~/.ddollar/ca/rootCA.pem
```

---

### Issue: "Certificate expired"

**Symptoms**:
```
Certificate validation failed: certificate expired on [date]
```

**Causes**:
- Certificate past 365-day validity period

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Automatic regeneration on next start
sudo ddollar start

# Or force regeneration
ddollar stop
rm -rf ~/.ddollar/certs
sudo ddollar start
```

**Note**: Certificate auto-renews on startup if expired.

---

### Issue: "Port 443 already in use"

**Symptoms**:
```
Failed to start server: listen tcp :443: bind: address already in use
```

**Causes**:
- Another service using port 443
- Previous ddollar instance still running

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Find process using port 443
sudo lsof -i :443

# Kill if it's ddollar
pkill ddollar

# Or kill specific process
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# Restart
sudo ddollar start
```

---

## üìã Checklist for Success

After implementation, users should be able to:

- [ ] Run `sudo ddollar start` once with zero manual steps
- [ ] Make HTTPS API calls immediately with no SSL warnings
- [ ] See ‚úì "CA trusted: Yes" in `ddollar status`
- [ ] Use Firefox without additional configuration (NSS auto-trusted)
- [ ] Get clear fallback instructions if automatic trust fails
- [ ] Manually control trust with `ddollar trust`/`untrust` commands
- [ ] Completely uninstall with `sudo ddollar untrust && rm -rf ~/.ddollar`

---

## üéì User Education

### What Changed

**Before this feature**:
```bash
# Old workflow (manual trust)
sudo ddollar start
# See error about untrusted certificates
# Copy long platform-specific command
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
    -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \
    ~/.ddollar/cert.pem
# Restart browser/apps to pick up trust
# Test API call
```

**After this feature**:
```bash
# New workflow (automatic)
sudo ddollar start
# Done! API calls work immediately
```

### Why Sudo Required

Clear explanation for users:

> **Why does ddollar need sudo?**
>
> ddollar modifies system security settings in two ways:
> 1. **Port 443**: Requires root to bind to privileged ports
> 2. **Trust stores**: System trust stores require admin/root to modify
>
> This is the same requirement as other local development tools (mkcert, Caddy).
>
> **Alternative**: Run without sudo and manually trust certificates afterward.

### Security Implications

Users should understand:

> **What ddollar can do with CA access**:
> - ddollar installs a Certificate Authority (CA) that your system trusts
> - This CA can sign certificates for any domain
> - ddollar only signs certificates for AI provider domains (api.anthropic.com, etc.)
> - The CA private key is stored locally (~/.ddollar/ca/)
> - You can remove trust at any time with: `sudo ddollar untrust`
>
> **This is safe because**:
> - CA is only used for local development
> - CA is isolated to your machine (not shared)
> - ddollar is open source (auditable)
> - Same approach used by mkcert (trusted by 48k+ developers)

## üìä Success Metrics

After implementation, track:

1. **Automatic Trust Success Rate**: % of `ddollar start` runs where trust succeeds
   - Target: >90% on standard desktop/server installations

2. **User Friction**: Average time from install to first successful API call
   - Target: <2 minutes (vs ~5 minutes with manual trust)

3. **Support Requests**: Certificate-related issues reported
   - Target: <10% of users need manual intervention

4. **Browser Compatibility**: % of users reporting SSL warnings
   - Target: <5% (only Firefox users without NSS auto-trust)
